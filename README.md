# Project Overview
Hi there,
This project implements all requested features and includes refactoring for improved code quality.
During development, some ideas for future improvements were noted in Notes.txt.
## Tests
The project contains unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
Follow these commands to run them:
#### Install the dependencies
```npm install```
#### Start the Application
```npm start```
#### Run Unit & Integration Tests
```npm test``` 
#### Run End-to-End (E2E) Tests

Note: If you are running the playwright for the first time, it will throw an error and prompt you to download it separately. Please follow the instructions it will give you. Let me know if anything goes wrong.
