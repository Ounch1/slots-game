Reel.ts:
- Not sure if method order is something up for refactoring, or a part of the stylistic guidelines.
I left it as is, as following pre-existing style was one of the requirements, but I'm pretty sure the convention is:
Public Properties -> Private Properties -> Constructor -> Public Methods -> Private Methods

Potential Improvements:
- AssetLoader should ideally load the appropriate assets from directories, instead of having to add them one by one manually. That way, scalability would be improved.
Would implement it right now, but it would take time and isn't relevant for the test.
- For the movement animation, it would be much better to use a tweening library, like GSAP or tween.js, as it would give more flexible control and improve clarity.
With some research I could implement it, but just like the asset loader, it would take time and isn't relevant for what is being tested.
- Ideally, code should be designed for Reel to both work horizontally and vertically, in case if something changes in the future, or if we want to reuse it for future projects.
 But horizontal spinning was the only requirement.
